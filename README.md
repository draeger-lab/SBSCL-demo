The [Systems Biology Simulation Core Library (SBSCL)](https://github.com/draeger-lab/SBSCL) is a computing library that provides a solver backend for working with systems biology models.
It provides interpreters, solvers, analysis methods, and mathematical tools.
This repository demonstrates how to work with SBSCL within a Java™ application.
The bytecode of SBSCL is generally useful in any environment that supports Java™ technology such as the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
Consequently, SBSCL can be directly accessed from several programming languages including Kotlin, Scala, Groovy, Python (through Jython), and more.
